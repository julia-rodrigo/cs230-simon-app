This helpful person thought me lots of basic javaScript in his tutorial.

First i coded along the full java in the video.
Then i removed some code to fit the basic description of the given assignment

Ive added a red light that will turn green when you hit start.
5 seconds after that, the paturn will start.

If you hit the wrong button, all four lights will flash together 
simultanously a couple of times

As the score increase, the timning gets faster, and then faster again. 
Only increase the speed twice

:) thank you
